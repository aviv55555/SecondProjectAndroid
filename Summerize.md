I created my second Android project based on my favorite childhood TV series, HaPijamot.  
When the app loads, the series' theme song plays, and 10 character images from the show are displayed in a RecyclerView.  
Tapping on a character opens a separate window with detailed information about them.  
The app also includes a search bar that allows users to find their favorite actor by name.  
Additionally, thereâ€™s an option to mute the music.
